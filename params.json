Born and educated in Western Romania, I chose to study Economics over Mathematics in order to be able to embrace the changes brought about by the new system. In a country with no tradition of market economy and no experience in teaching and researching this subject it was however hard to get a proper formal training in this field. After receiving the Bachelors Degree in Economics at The West University of Timișoara I decided to continue my studies in Germany, at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin.\r\n\r\nHere I pursued the Master’s Program in Economics and Management Science (M.Sc.) with majors in Economics and Statistics. The work during my master’s thesis under the supervision of Prof. Harald Uhlig encouraged my interest in quantitative research and rekindled my passion for mathematics through its implementation for formal economic modelling. At the same time, it strengthened my confidence that I could do significant work motivated by real world questions if I deepened my statistical knowledge. I decided to apply for a doctoral program that would allow me to follow these interests. I loved Berlin and the Humboldt-Universität had a good academic environment - I pursued my Ph.D. at the Ladislaus von Bortkiewicz Chair of Statistics, under the supervision of Prof. Wolfgang Härdle. \r\n\r\nDuring my thesis work, I did research in a range of interconnected fields that include financial econometrics, applied statistics, and economics. Topic-wise, I became interested in learning about the interface between individual and collective risk perception, its propagation in more realistic systemic environments and the feed-back effects between the micro-macro levels. Concurrently, the formal analysis of these phenomenon through experimental and field data set new challenges to implement tailored statistical and econometric techniques for the estimation and inference, which allow to study the aggregate behavior of heterogeneous subjects under limited information and in constrained interactive set-ups. \r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
