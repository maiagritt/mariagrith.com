abstract = "Supported by several recent investigations, the empirical pricing kernel (PK) puzzle might be considered as a stylized fact. Based on an economic model with reference-dependent preferences for the financial investors, we emphasize a microeconomic view that explains the puzzle via state-dependent aggregate preferences. We also investigate how the shape of the PK estimated from option and stock market index returns changes in relation to the volatility risk premium."
