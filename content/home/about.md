### About me

I am an Assistant Professor in Econometrics at the Erasmus School of Economics. I received my Ph.D. in Economics in 2013 from the Humboldt University of Berlin. Prior to joining Erasmus, I had postdoctoral appointments at Humboldt University of Berlin, University of Pennsylvania and Singapore Management University.

My work is concerned with developing statistical methods to study dynamic high-dimensional data settings and relies on nonparametric and semiparametric approaches, as well as graphical models. The applications of the research lie mostly in the field of finance, where I am particularly interested in asset pricing and systemic risk.

This is my [curriculum vitae](Maria Grith - Curriculum Vitae - Rotterdam.pdf).
