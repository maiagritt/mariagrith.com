### About me

I am a Hilda Geiringer postdoctoral fellow in statistics and economics at the Humboldt University of Berlin. Prior to this appointment, I was a Warren Center postdoctoral fellow at the University of Pennsylvania. I received my Ph.D. in Economics in 2013 from the Humboldt University of Berlin.

My research interests lie at the intersection of econometrics, statistics and finance. My work is concerned with finding general ways to study the identification, estimation and inference in high-dimensional dynamic models. It relies on nonparametric and semiparametric methods, and covers topics in functional data and time series analysis. My recent research focuses on graphical models for time series, including nonstationary, nonlinear and latent variable processes. Applications lie mostly in the field of finance, where I am particularly interested in equilibrium and arbitrage-free pricing models, and asset markets.
